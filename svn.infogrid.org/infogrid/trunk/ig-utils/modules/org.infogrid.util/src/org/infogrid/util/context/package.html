  <p>Implements a light-weight mechanism for objects to find
     basic application services.</p>
  <p>Many application objects (but not <code>MeshObjects</code>})
     in InfoGrid implement the
     {@link org.infogrid.util.context.ObjectInContext ObjectInContext} interface.
     An <code>ObjectInContext</code> runs
     in a {@link org.infogrid.util.context.Context}, which collects a number of environment objects
     which the <code>ObjectInContext</code> may need. In this respect,
     it is not all that different from what traditional programming does with
     environment variables. However, one can only have one set of environment
     variables per application, but there can be an arbitrary number of
     <code>Context</code>s per application, each of which may contain a different
     set of application services.</p>
  <p>A class implementing <code>ObjectInContext</code> is typically instantiated with a
      <code>Context</code> parameter in the constructor. An <code>ObjectInContext</code>'s
      <code>Context</code> typically does not change during the lifetime of the
     <code>ObjectInContext</code>. The objects in the <code>Context</code> may
     change, but not the <code>Context</code> itself.</p>
  <p>A <code>Context</code> collects any number of objects, which generally are
     being found through lookups based on their class or interface.</p>
  <p>Contexts can be hierarchical, and InfoGrid makes use of that. If a (child)
     Context does not hold a requested object locally, it delegates the query
     to its (parent) Context.</p>
  <p>Through configuration of which objects are added to which contexts, one can
     easily configure large-scale changes to major InfoGrid subsystems with minimum
     effort. Also, objects can gracefully offer only part of their functionality if
     certain objects are not present in the environment.</p>
  <p>The <code>SimpleContext</code> class provides a simple implementation
     of the <code>Context</code> interface that is sufficient for most uses.</p>
