  <p>HTTP utility classes and methods.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the JDK and JEE either don't provide HTTP-related methods
     that it should have provided in the first place, or the API is rather
     incomplete and not usable for REST-ful applications. This package
     provides some concepts that alleviate this problem.</p>
