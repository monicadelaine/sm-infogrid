  <p>Contains the InfoGrid Probe Framework.</p>
  <p>Sub-packages provide support for particular data sources.</p>
  <p>Implementing WritableProbe allows changes to written out to data sources.</p>
  <p>The WritableProbe interface is supported by all Probes that can both
     read and write their data.</p>
  <p>Classes supporting this interface need to have a constructor
     with no parameters. The sequence of invocation is:</p>
  <pre>
     constructor
     for( one or more times ) {
         read( ... )
         wait for some period of time
         write( ... ) [optional, WritableProbe only]
     }</pre>
  <p>WritableProbes, in their read method, must make sure that MeshObjects
     have the right access rights. If the access rights are not set correctly,
     application code will try to update MeshObjects that the underlying Probe
     is unable to update in the underlying data source.<p>
  <p>If a probe is a WritableProbe, it's write() method will be called
     immediately before any call to it's read*() method. The definative
     copy of the data always resides in the probe's source and any changes
     that do not make it into the probe's source will be overwritten by
     the probe's read() method.<p>
