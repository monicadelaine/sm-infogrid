<body>
<p>Core concepts and classes to manage
   sets of {@link org.infogrid.mesh.MeshObject MeshObjects} and related concepts as a unit.
   {@link org.infogrid.mesh.set.MeshObjectSet MeshObjectSets} may be defined as immutable,
   i.e. they cannot change after they have been created, if they support marker interface
   {@link org.infogrid.mesh.set.ImmutableMeshObjectSet}. If a <code>MeshObject</code>
   does not support interface <code>ImmutableMeshObjectSet</code>, no statement is made
   about whether or not the <code>MeshObjectSet</code> is immutable or not.</p>
<p>The base concept is a {@link org.infogrid.mesh.set.MeshObjectSet MeshObjectSet},
   which contains zero or more {@link org.infogrid.mesh.MeshObject MeshObjects}. This
   interface provides methods to obtain the members in the set, to test for existence of
   members in the set, etc.</p>
<p>It also provides additional methods that make <code>MeshObject</code> traversal
   easier. For example, <code>MeshObjectSet</code> provides a convenience method to construct
   another <code>MeshObjectSet</code> whose members are determined by traversing a 
   certain {@link org.infogrid.model.traversal.TraversalSpecification TraversalSpecification}
   from each member of the set.</p> 
<p>Simple implementations for this interface are provided in package
   <code>org.infogrid.mesh.set.m</code>.</p>
<p>{@link org.infogrid.mesh.set.OrderedMeshObjectSet OrderedMeshObjectSet}
   is a <tt>MeshObjectSet</tt> whose content is known to be ordered in some fashion.</p>
<p>Compare with {@link org.infogrid.mesh.set.TraversalPathSet TraversalPathSet},
   which is a set of {@link org.infogrid.model.traversal.TraversalPath TraversalPaths} to
   a set of <code>MeshObjects</code>.</p>
 <p>Also defines sets of
    {@link org.infogrid.model.traversal.TraversalPath TraversalPaths},
    and several implementations. The classes
    defined in this package are all snapshot sets, i.e. they have immutable content
    once they have been constructed. However, other packages may implement the interfaces
    in this package differently, or subclass the
    classes in this package and use them to define active behavior, i.e. a set may change its
    content after it has been created.</p></body>
