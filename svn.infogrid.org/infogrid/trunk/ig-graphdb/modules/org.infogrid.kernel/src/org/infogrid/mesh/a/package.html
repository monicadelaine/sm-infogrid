    <title>The org.infogrid.mesh.a package</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>A simple implementation of {@link org.infogrid.mesh.MeshObject MeshObject},
       called the A implementation.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> As an application developer, you should never have to deal with this
       or any other {@link org.infogrid.mesh.MeshObject MeshObject} implementation
       package. This package is only of interest to implementors of alternate internal
       representations of <code>MeshObjects</code> &mdash; which is very few people.
       If you believe you simply have to write code that is aware of this package,
       chances are high you are doing something wrong.</p>
