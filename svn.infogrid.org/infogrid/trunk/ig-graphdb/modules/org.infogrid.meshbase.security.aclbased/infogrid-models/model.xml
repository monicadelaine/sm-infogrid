        <userdescription>This Subject Area defines the security concepts that define
Security of MeshObjects via an Access Control List (ACL) mechanism.</userdescription>

access control policies.</userdescription>

            <userdescription>Instances of this RelationshipType relate MeshObjects to their owning MeshObject or
MeshObjects. Any MeshObject that does not participate in this relationship as source (ie doesn't
have an owner) is assumed to own itself. An owner MeshObject may assign another MeshObject as an
additional owner. An owner (and only an owner) may delete itself as an owner, but then cannot
make itself an owner again unless another owner re-assigns ownership to the old owner. Multiple
MeshObject may all be owners of the same MeshObject; they all have the same rights.</userdescription>

            <userdescription>Instances of this RelationshipType relate a ProtectionDomain to the MeshObjects that it governs.
Any MeshObject that is not governed by a ProtectionDomain is assumed to have the following
access control policy: anybody has read access; only its owner may update or delete.</userdescription>
