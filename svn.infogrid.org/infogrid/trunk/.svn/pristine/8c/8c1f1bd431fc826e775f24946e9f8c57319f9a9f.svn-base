/**
 * <p>This interface is supported by all Probes that can
 * read some kind of non-XML file format from a stream.</p>
 *
 * <p>Classes supporting this interface need to have a constructor
 *    that does not take any parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>The sequence of invocations is:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   Probe constructor
 *   for( one or more times ) {
 *       read( ... )
 *       wait for some period of time, depending on the CoherenceSpecification in effect
 *       write( ... ) [optional: only for Probes that also implement WritableProbe]
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>This sequence may be repeated itself many times, even for the same data source:
 * the Probe instance may be garbage collected in between. Garbage collection may also
 * occur between the read and the write call.</p>
 * <p>Note: Probes <b>must not</b> store persistent data in any place other than the
 * MeshObjects that they instantiate.</p>

     * <p>Read from the InputStream and instantiate corresponding MeshObjects.</p>
     * <p>This method declares
     * many different types of Exceptions; that enables the Probe Framework to handle many
     * possible error conditions out of the box, thereby making Probe programming easier.
     * Note that many of the declared Exceptions, if actually thrown, indicate a programming
     * error in the Probe implementation (e.g. IsAbstractException).</p>
     * <p>The Probe framework invokes this method with an open Transaction on the current Thread;
     * the Probe developer does not have to worry about Transactions.</p>
     * 
     * @param dataSourceIdentifier identifies the data source that is being accessed
     * @param coherenceSpecification the type of data coherence that is requested by the application. Probe
     *         implementors may ignore this parameter, letting the Probe framework choose its own policy.
     *         If the Probe chooses to define its own policy (considering or ignoring this parameter), the
     *         Probe must bless the Probe's HomeObject with a subtype of <code>ProbeUpdateSpecification</code> (defined
     *         in the <code>org.infogrid.model.Probe</code> Subject Area) and suitable Property
     *         values that reflect the policy.
     * @param stream the InputStream to read from
     * @param contentType the content type (MIME) if known
     * @param freshMeshBase the StagingMeshBase in which the corresponding MeshObjects are to be instantiated by the Probe.
     *         This StagingMeshBase is empty when passed into this call, except for the home object which always exists
     * @throws EntityBlessedAlreadyException thrown if a MeshObject was incorrectly blessed twice with the same
     *         EntityType. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws EntityNotBlessedException thrown if a MeshObject was not blessed with a required EntityType.
     *         Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws IllegalPropertyTypeException thrown if a MeshObject did not carry a PropertyType that it needed
     *         to carry. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws IllegalPropertyValueException thrown if a PropertyValue was assigned to a property that was
     *         outside of the allowed range. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws IOException an input/output error occurred during execution of the Probe
     * @throws IsAbstractException thrown if an EntityType or a Relationship could not be instantiated because
     *         it was abstract. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws MeshObjectIdentifierNotUniqueException thrown if the Probe developer incorrectly
     *         assigned duplicate MeshObjectsIdentifiers to created MeshObjects.
     *         Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws ModuleException thrown if a Module required by the Probe could not be loaded
     * @throws NotPermittedException thrown if an operation performed by the Probe was not permitted
     * @throws NotRelatedException thrown if a relationship was supposed to become blessed, but the relationship
     *         did not exist. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws ProbeException a Probe error occurred per the possible subclasses defined in ProbeException
     * @throws RelatedAlreadyException thrown if the Probe developer incorrectly attempted to
     *         relate two already-related MeshObjects. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws RoleTypeBlessedAlreadyException thrown if a relationship was incorrectly blessed twice with the same
     *         RelationshipType, in the same direction. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws TransactionException a Transaction problem occurred. Throwing this typically indicates a programming error.
     * @throws URISyntaxException thrown if a URI was constructed in an invalid way
     * @throws ParseException thrown if parsing failed
