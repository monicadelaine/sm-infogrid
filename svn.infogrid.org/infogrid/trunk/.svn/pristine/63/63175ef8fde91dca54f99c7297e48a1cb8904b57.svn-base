      <p>Provides testing infrastructure.</p>
      <p>This is somewhat comparable to what jUnit does, except:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>We can test larger assemblies of functionality than jUnit can.</li>
          <li>We don't create funny conventions for the naming of tests.</li>
          <li>Our facilities make the testing of InfoGrid modules much simpler as they are aware of InfoGrid concepts
              and they are integrated with the Module Framework.</li>
      </ul>
