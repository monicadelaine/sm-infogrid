    <p>Provides facilities to subset a key namespace in a
    {@link org.infogrid.store.Store} into
    {@link org.infogrid.store.prefixing.PrefixingStore PrefixingStores}.</p>
    
    <p>For example, one <code>Store</code> with a physical implementation may be partitioned into several
       <code>PrefixingStores</code>, which, to the developed, act as if they were entirely separate.
       However, a <code>PrefixingStore</code> simply delegates all operations to an underlying <code>Store</code>
       by prefixing all keys with a particular String. Arbitrarily complex hierarchies are possible, although
       at a (small) performance penalty.</p>
    <p>This allows developers to build a single physical <code>Store</code> for all of their horizontal
       data storage needs, while partitioning it in arbitrarily small subsets through a suitable set of
       <code>PrefixingStores</code>.</p>
