# Protect against "Unprocessed Continuation Reference(s)" which will show as a
# message in the error log and appear as an error message like
# this: "xxxx is not a valid user name"
# It's wise to leave the following proerty set as is
java.naming.referral=follow

# Type of authentication
java.naming.security.authentication=simple

# Account name of the LDAP manager account
# This is usually of the form WINDOWSDOMAIN\\userid

# Password of an LDAP account
java.naming.security.credentials=PASSWORD

# Prefix to append to the identifier for authentication, if any
# This is workaround to put a prefix on names that are looked up in LDAP.
# You may or may not need it depending upon how names are stored in LDAP.
# If you do it'll usually be the same as the Windows domain name.
#org.infogrid.authp.va.ldap.IdentifierPrefix=YOUR_DOMAIN\\

# Context in which to look for entries. If this is not given, use the root
# context defined by java.naming.provider.url
# You will most likely need to set this to something like: dc=domain_name,dc=ent
org.infogrid.authp.va.ldap.Context=dc=your_domain,dc=ent

# Filter to use to find an entry. By default, this looks for exact matches in
# attribute sAMAccountName e.g. (sAMAccountName={0})
# The default filter can be improved by explictly setting it to something more
# complex to do a faster search.
# Uncomment the line below to try the faster search filter

# Comma-separated list of attributes to pull out of LDAP. If not given, pull out all of them.
# Add values to this list once you are able to successfully display attributes.
# If values are not being displayed properly, they could be binary and you
 # should name them in the property: java.naming.ldap.attributes.binary above.
