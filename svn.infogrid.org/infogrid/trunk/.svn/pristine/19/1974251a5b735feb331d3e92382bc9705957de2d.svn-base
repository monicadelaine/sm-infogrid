/**
 * <p>A software component of an application's JEE user interface.
 *    Conceptually, the user interface of an InfoGrid web application consists of Viewlets.
 *    These Viewlets can be supported by Servlets and/or JSPs, which can rely on the fact that a specific
 *    JeeViewlet exists for them &quot;behind the,&quot;; this makes programming much simpler.
 *    Among them, it makes it easy to deliver the same JeeViewlet functionality in multiple
 *    locales.</p>
 * <p>JEE Viewlets are somewhat comparable with Java portlets, but much simpler and built around
 *    a REST-ful, identity-aware design.</p>
 * <p>A JeeViewlet typically has a subject, which is given as a <code>MeshObject</code>. For example,
 *    a JeeViewlet showing an electronic business card might have the owner of the business card
 *    as the subject.</p>
 * <p>The <code>JeeViewlet</code> interface is supported by all InfoGrid Viewlets.</p>
