/**
 * <p>The core abstraction in InfoGrid.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Each MeshObject is identified by a {@link MeshObjectIdentifier}, which
 * is globally unique. Each MeshObject is managed by exactly one
 * {@link org.infogrid.meshbase.MeshBase}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Each MeshObject may be blessed by one or more {@link org.infogrid.model.primitives.EntityType}s,
 * which may define properties for the MeshObject (by means of
 * {@link org.infogrid.model.primitives.PropertyType}).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Each MeshObject can stand on its own; pairs of MeshObjects may enter into relationships,
 * each of which may be blessed by one or more {@link org.infogrid.model.primitives.RelationshipType}s.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Properties of MeshObjects may be read, and relationships may be traversed outside
 * of {@link org.infogrid.meshbase.transaction.Transaction} boundaries; for updates, Transactions
 * are needed. (See {@link org.infogrid.meshbase.MeshBase#createTransactionNow} and similar
 * methods)</p>
 * 
 * <p>A MeshObject may be part of an equivalence set. In InfoGrid, an equivalence set of
 * MeshObjects collects one or more MeshObjects and considers them semantically equivalent.
 * When traversing relationships, all relationships of the MeshObjects in the equivalence
 * set are considered as if they were relationships of the same MeshObject.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A caller may or may not have the appropriate authorization to perform any of the
 * operations that may throw NotPermittedException, in which this exception is thrown.
 * Other operations may silently return only a subset of the information they could return
 * to some callers. The interface does not make any statements on this level about
 * the exact behavior, other than stating that the experienced behavior may be different
 * for different callers.</p>
