  <p>Implementation of MeshTypes in a memory-only form.</p>
  <p>Note: as an application programmer, you should <b>never</b> have to access
     this package directly, as your code should be independent of whether the
     MeshTypes are implemented in memory or in some other fashion. You can and should
     import this package's parent package, which provides only
     implementation-independent interfaces.</p>
