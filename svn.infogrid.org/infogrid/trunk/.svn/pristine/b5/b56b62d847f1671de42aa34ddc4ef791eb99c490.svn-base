/**
  * <p>MeshBase represents the place where MeshObjects live. MeshBases collect MeshObjects
  * for management purposes. A MeshBase may be persistent (i.e. retain the contained
  * MeshObjects after reboot), or it may be volatile; however, this distinction is not
  * visible by a client of a MeshBase other than the result of the
  * {@link #isPersistent method}.</p>
  *
  * <p>Many "interesting" operations on the MeshBase are delegated to
  * managers of various sorts that may or may not be supported by any
  * given MeshBase implementation.</p>
  *
  * <p>A MeshBase's home object is a single MeshObject in the MeshBase
  * that is "known" to the outside world. This might often be some sort of
  * "directory object", or an object which is a logical entry point into the
  * information held by the MeshBase. The home object cannot be deleted, but
  * it may be updated (e.g. blessed, properties set, related etc.)</p>
  * 
  * <p>All operations potentially modifying information held in a MeshBase must be performed
  *    within a {@link Transaction}. A good pattern to use for Transactions is this:
  * <pre>
  * Transaction tx = null;
  * try {
  *    tx = meshBase.createTransactionXXX(); // use one of the factory methods
  *    // code that is subject to the Transaction
  * } catch( ... ) {
  *    // catch code for whatever Exceptions need to be handled
  * } finally {
  *    if( tx != null ) {
  *        tx.commit();
  *    }
  * }
  * </pre>
  * <p>This code works with all Transaction factory methods, including the ones that do not
  * actually create a Transaction under some circumstances because the current Thread
  * has an open Transaction already.</p>
