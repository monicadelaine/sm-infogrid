/**
 * <p>A <code>Store</code> is an abstraction for a data store that behaves like a persistent
 * Java <code>java.util.Map</code> keyed with String, and with byte arrays as values.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Classes implementing this Store interface may store information in a variety of
 * different ways, including in file systems, in databases, or even on P2P networks.
 * Application developers can usually program directly against this interface, without
 * having to be aware aware of the specific class implementing it.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When storing or retrieving data element, various meta-data values are being
 * carried around:</p>
 * <dl>
 *  <dt><code>EncodingId</code></dt>
 *  <dd>An application-defined value that represents the encoder used for storing the
 *      data. This is roughly comparable to the idea of a file system descriptor
 *      in a UNIX-like operating system, but it applies on a data element-level.</dd>
 *  <dt><code>TimeCreated</code></dt>
 *  <dd>Time the data element was created, as seen by the application. This value may
 *      be different from the time at which this data element was first inserted into
 *      the <code>Store</code>.</dd>
 *  <dt><code>TimeUpdated</code></dt>
 *  <dd>Time the data element was last updated, as seen by the application. This value may
 *      be different from the time at which this data element was lasted updated in
 *      the <code>Store</code>.</dd>
 *  <dt><code>TimeRead</code></dt>
 *  <dd>Time the data element was last read, as seen by the application. This value may
 *      be different from the time at which this data element was last retrieved from
 *      the <code>Store</code>.</dt>
 *  <dt><code>TimeInvalid</code></dt>
 *  <dd>If positive, this represents the time at which this data element will become invalid.
 *      The definition of invalid is up to the application; an application may choose
 *      to treat invalid StoreValues as if they didn't exist (which is facilitated by
 *      the property <code>ignoreInvalid</code> settable by some <code>Store</code>
 *      implementations) or any other strategy that makes sense to the application. This
 *      is a core meta-data element in order to enable administration from outside of
 *      the application (e.g. by a database administrator who can delete expired rows from
 *      a SQL implementation of <code>Store</code> outside of the application.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><code>StoreListeners</code> may be used to listen to Store operations, e.g. for
 * logging purposes.</p>
 * <p>This interface uses the format defined by <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>
 * to encode all time values.</p>
