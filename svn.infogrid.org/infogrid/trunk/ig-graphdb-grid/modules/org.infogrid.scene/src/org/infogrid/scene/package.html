<p>Contains concepts and mechanisms to construct complex "scenes" of
   interrelated MeshObjects.</p>

<p>A Scene is a collection of related MeshObjects. The Scene identifies certain
   MeshObjects as playing a certain SceneRole within the Scene.</p>

<p>For example, if we have the following Model:</p>
<pre>
    Person
    Person.IsParentOf.Parent
</pre>
<p>and if we have the following instances of the Model (with indentation indicating
   a parent relationship)</p>
<pre>
    Person 1
        Person 1-1
        Person 1-2
            Person 1-2-1
            Person 1-2-2
</pre>
<p>a Scene called ExtendedFamily might identify the following MeshObjects with the following
   SceneRoles:</p>
<pre>
    Person 1 : Grandparent
    Person 1-2: Parent (not Person 1-1 as they do not have children)
    Person 1-2-1: Child
    Person 1-2-2: Child
</pre>

<p>The definition of the Scene's structure is provided by a SceneTemplate. A SceneTemplate can be
   instantiated an arbitrary number of times, as long as the underlying MeshObjects are
   different. There can be only one instance of a SceneTemplate (i.e. a Scene) for the same
   combination of MeshObjects.</p>

<p>SceneTemplates define their particular structure through</p>
<ul>
 <li>the concept of a SceneTemplateRole, which specifies participation constraints (multiplicity)</li>
 <li>and through SceneTemplate-specific code, located in the particular subclass of SceneTemplate,
     that knows how MeshObjects relate to each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the subclass of SceneTemplate called ExtendedFamilySceneTemplate used for the example
   above would have three SceneTemplateRoles, called GrandParent, Parent and Child. The multiplicities
   of those SceneTemplateRoles would be 1:1 (exactly one GrandParent), 1:N (at least one Parent),
   1:N (at least one Person). In addition, the implementation of ExtendedFamilySceneTemplate knows how
   to traverse from any object that plays the GrandParent SceneTemplateRole, to the objects that
   play the Parent SceneTemplateRole, etc.</p>

<p>A use of any particular SceneTemplate with a concrete set of objects produces a Scene, or,
   more likely, an instance of a subclass of Scene (that typically goes with the particular
   subclass of SceneTemplate that was used to instantiate it). In the example above, this may be
   a subclass called ExtendedFamilyScene. The SceneTemplateRoles are correspondingly instantiated
   into SceneRoles</p>
   
<p>A SceneDirectory contains the current set of known Scenes. It also acts as a smart factory, from
   the SceneTemplates that have been registered with the SceneDirectory. In order to be reasonably
   efficient, the SceneDirectory creates the objects that are needed to represent the Scenes on demand,
   and makes them available for garbage collection as soon as they are not referenced any more. From
   the perspective of the user of the SceneDirectory, these operations are transparent.</p>

<p>Further, Scenes (i.e. instances of SceneTemplates bound to particular sets of objects) can, in
   principle, be complete or incomplete (the subclass of SceneTemplate determines that). Scenes
   may implement a method makeComplete() that attempts to do its best to complete a Scene.</p>

<p>To add MeshObjects to a Scene, the concept of a SceneAdditionCandidate (and its type, a
   SceneTemplateAdditionCandidate) is used. A SceneAdditionCandidate is a candidate for addition to
   a Scene that can be instantiated by a user of the Scene without having to know any details of
   how many MeshObjects, relationships and other modifications are being performed etc. This provides
   a very convenient abstract layer. For example, programmers can construct GUI code that only
   depends on Scenes, bu not on which specific types of scenes, and thus can be used to instantiate
   a variety of different objects and relationships, depending on which scene is passed in.
   SceneTemplateAdditionCandidates and SceneAdditionCandidates provide default implementations and
   can be overridden by particular Scene implementations if needed.</p>
   
<p>To implement a new SceneTemplate, subclass SceneTemplate. There is only one main method to implement
   which creates the particular Scene from a set of candidate objects for its particular
   SceneTemplateRoles. The implementation can choose any approach to implement this factory method;
   however, it is usually a good idea to build from the pre-defined implementations of
   ActiveRootEntitySet, such as TraversalActiveRootEntitySet. For example, the above SceneTemplate
   could implement the essence of this method as follows:</p>
<pre>
   protected Scene match(
            SceneRole.Root                  givenRootRole,
            SceneRole.PlayedByMeshObject [] givenEntityRoles,
            SceneRole.PlayedByScene []      givenSceneRoles,
            ModelObjectLifecycleManager     life,
            SceneDirectory                  directory )
        throws
            MatchAmbiguousException
    {
        if( givenRootRole == null ) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        if( givenEntityRoles != null && givenEntityRoles.length != 0 ) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(); // optional
        }
        if( givenSceneRoles != null && givenSceneRoles.length != 0 ) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(); // optional
        }
        if( givenRootRole.getTemplateRole() != GRAND_PARENT_ROLE ) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        if( !( givenRootRole.getRootPlayer() instanceof Person )) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        /* Person */ MeshObject grandParent = (Person) givenRootRole.getRootPlayer();

        ActiveTraversalPathSet parents = TraversalActiveTraversalPathSet.create(
                constructSceneWithRoleName( grandParent, PARENT_ROLE ),
                grandParent,
                theIsParentOf.getSource() );

        ActiveTraversalPathSet children = TraversalActiveTraversalPathSet.create(
                constructSceneWithRoleName( parents, CHILD_ROLE ),
                parents,
                theIsParentOf.getSource() );

        return new ChildAccountsScene(
                directory,
                this,
                SceneRole.createRootRole( GRAND_PARENT_ROLE, grandParent ),
                new SceneRole.PlayedByMeshObject[] {
                        SceneRole.createEntityRole( PARENT_ROLE, parents ),
                        SceneRole.createEntityRole( CHILD_ROLE,  children ) },
                null,
                null );
    }
</pre>

<p>SceneRoles can also be played by Scenes themselves. This allows the construction of
   complex Scenes from other Scenes, and so forth.</p>
