PlainString=MeshWorld was unable to connect to the specified database. You can still use \
    MeshWorld BUT ONLY if you are okay that all data is stored in memory only. It will be \
    lost when MeshWorld quits. Given that MeshWorld is only a demonstration application, \
    that might be fine for your purposes. Otherwise, please make sure to set up the database \
    before continuing.
