      <userdescription>This entitytype is an abstract supertype for components inside a structured, potentially
hierarchical definition (represented by DefinitionObject). In programming, for example, a member variable
of a class could be represented as a (subtype of) ComponentObject.</userdescription>

      <userdescription>DefinitionObject serves as an abstract supertype for all definitions which may
be reused. A DefinitionObject may contain ComponentObjects, indicating that the definition is
structured. The ComponentObjects contained in a DefinitionObject form the components of
the structured definition. DefinitionObjects are referenced by ComponentObjects, indicating
the definition of the ComponentObject. In programming, for example, a class could be represented
as a (subtype of) DefinitionObject. Its member variables would be (subtypes of) ComponentObject,
which would be contained in the DefinitionObject. In turn, the contained ComponentObjects reference
other DefinitionObjects (representing other classes, for example), to indicate their own structure.</userdescription>
